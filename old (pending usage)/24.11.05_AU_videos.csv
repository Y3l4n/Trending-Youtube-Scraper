Each week one classic location of the Chapter 2 Remix map will be taken over by one of the four artists. In addition to the location change, each artist will also have a weapon themed to them. See the weekly breakdown:

Week 1 (starting November 2nd)
The Agency compound is now The Doggpound. The Doggfather will gift you Snoop’s Drum Gun Mythic if you can defeat him, and will join you as an ally!

Week 2 (starting November 7th)
The Grotto lair turns into Spaghetti Grotto. And if you can defeat Eminem, he’ll join your cause and bestow you with his RG Minigun. 

Week 3 (starting November 14th)
The Shark is now dubbed Ice Isle with Ice Spice claiming dibs! Defeat Ice to add her to your team and get Ice Spice’s Grappler and Ice Spice’s Rifle Mythics!

Week 4 (starting November 21st)
Keep an eye to the skies at the WRLD Point landmark arriving in Week 4.

In addition to the Remix aspect of weekly artist takeovers, you’ll notice that familiarity is also in the air. Favorite vehicles like Choppas and Motorboats return later in the season. Classic Chapter 2 weapons are also making an appearance as they unvault throughout the season. There’s also new vehicle features like the 1966 Cadillac DeVille which has hydraulics, bounces to music, and can jump in the air!

Finally, with Chapter 2 Remix you’re getting an all-new Chapter 2 inspired Pass. This pass includes Outfits like: Chaos Director, 1-Ball, Undercover Skye, Meowdas, and Dynamo TNTina. Not to mention Kicks– a new cosmetic type that will be featured for the first time in the Remix Pass with a pair of Jordan’s. 

Throwback and look forward in Chapter 2 Remix.

The snail is added. 

Welcome to WILD LIFE the next season in the Wild Life series. This time, there will be a different twist that affects the game every session/episode (only one person episode). The twists may or may not present some danger to the participants. 

This season, we have 6 lives. 4-6 Lives you have a dark green name. 3 lives you have a lime green name. 2 lives you have a yellow name and on your last and final life, you turn hostile and red. The last player standing, wins. Dark green names are able to have lives stolen from them when killed by a red or yellow life. Only Red names can kill anyone. 




Enjoy!

There's this creature that is shockingly similar to an alien. It basically is a mutant creature with the body of a scorpion, mouth of a spider, and claws that look like saws.

I had thought it was dead, but it seems the ecosystem and conditions within the vivarium were perfect for the egg's incubation, as it failed to rot and decompose even after over a month later. I felt, for my safety and that of the animals within the vivarium, it was time to take matters into my own hands and dig up the mystery egg to candle it and check for a living fetus. Doing so was quite the adventure. Hope you enjoy this Episode 10, Season 3 of my Eocsystem Vivarium Series. Ant love forever! This video was shot in 4K Ultra HD resolution.

This Is What Happens When a Psychopath Chooses Chaos - Once Human - Let's Game It Out

 #OnceHuman #thewayofwinter

----------

More about Once Human (from Steam):

[Version 1.3] NEW PVE SCENARIO
Survive Together, Thrive Together!

Version 1.3 introduces the new PvE scenario ""The Way of Winter."" A new survival mechanic, Temperature, makes survival more challenging than ever! Collaborate with your friends to build and upgrade the Thermal Tower. Team up now to explore the new map, face mighty bosses, secure new deviations, and discover even more exciting content!

The apocalypse changed everything. Human, animal, plant… all are infested by an alien creature – Stardust. As a Meta-Human, you can survive the contamination and use the power of Stardust. Play alone or join others to fight, build and explore. When the world is in chaos, you are our last hope.

Survive in the wilderness
You wake up in the middle of nowhere. You'll have to brace yourself for the cruelty of nature (from monsters to lack of food); however, Stardust's influence does not restrict to living things, it also affects the soil and water. Eating polluted food and drinking dirty water will reduce your Sanity. When your Sanity drops, your max HP would drop accordingly. To eat or not to eat, it's a question.

Fight against monsters
Battle numerous enemies that are once human, and challenge bosses from another dimension to gain powerful items and ease Stardust pollution. You are not only fighting for yourself, but also fighting for the survivors.

Customize weapons
With about 100 gun blueprints divided into seven categories for you to collect and craft, every loot grants you something new. Did I mention accessories and gun perks? Right, they are the heroes here. If our current weapon cannot satisfy your need, you can add different parts and perks, upgrade your firearm to your heart's content.

Build territory
Use Territory Core to build a house of your own. You can keep a practical style, jamming everything needed in a small room; or you can design a townhouse with a patio, kitchen, garage… The best part is, you can relocate your territory any time you want!

Find out the truth
Delve into the truth of Stardust, find out where it came from, and what it wants. In the journey of seeking truth, you may feel alone, but you are never alone. There are several factions in the world, some can be violent and hostile, others might be friendly and helpful.

I be laughing to the bank in my Maybach
Left hand kiss that big rock
Tunnel vision twenty twenty top notch
Spent a milly on some fits I’m so hot
Put some ice on my wrist that’s water

I’m on it on it got it flaunt it
Got your world in my pocket
Zero hundred like Ferrari
Hit the gas
Who gon’ stop me
You love when BABYMONSTER hits
Cartier stacked up on my wrist
Flip my hair and blow a kiss
Not a dentist but I’m flossin’ sis

"AmZleTKYYQI","How To Build A Shelf Between Two Walls","2024-10-27T03:31:13Z","UCFMGCDS4rQprREJJa8f4F0Q","HAUS PLANS™️","Howto & Style","24.11.05","""[none]""","83","6187583","165574","0","1744","888000","0.027040930198431276","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AmZleTKYYQI/default.jpg","Here’s the fastest and easiest way to build a shelf between two walls.
Using a level, I mark a line on all three walls at the bottom of the shelf.
And yes- a laser would work great for this, but I want to show how you can do basic jobs with simple tools.
Next, I measure the depth of the shelves and cut two cleats out of 2x4s- I left room to add a face board later.
Then I cut 4 more 2x4s to run between the cleats, making a ladder wall.
Three-inch deck screws work great for jobs like this- I put two per stud.
It’s important to measure the width of the shelf at the back wall and at the front because it can vary.
I screw the frame to the wall making sure to hit studs- that’s not going anywhere.
Now let’s cut the plywood- no fancy track saw, no problem. Just clamp down a straight board to use as a guide.
After dry fitting the plywood, I could see there was a bulge on the side wall keeping the shelf from sliding all the way back.
So, I use my pencil like a scribe, now I can cut the plywood to fit the wall.
I apply liquid nails to the frame and set the shelf down- fits like a glove.
Next, I load 1 ¾” trim nails into my 15-gauge trim gun to shoot it down.
I measure with a tape- making sure to hit the frame.
When I cut the face board, I use a 2-degree bevel, this way it’s a little longer in the front than the back and makes it fit super snug (you can see here what a good fit I got).
Don’t worry -The nail holes get filled before it’s painted.
At this point I was so tired I decided to take a nap.
And then, the New Guy actually came out of his office to paint it for me.

I learned of a local legend, that told of a hidden cave with a shadowy past. The story claims this was a hideout used by German spies during World War II, to prey upon top secret military bases. But is it true? In this episode, I venture into this remote desert region, to find this site for myself, and examine the mysteries behind it.  #history #exploration #historyadventure #hiking #worldwar2 #archaeology #cave #adventuretravel

And welcome to another video… as you guys know, I am a serial online shopper. And a little while ago, I started noticing a LOT of QVC-esque shopping livestreams on my TikTok for you page…. Wigs, crystal scoops, and athleisure galore!! So I decided to investigate to see what it was actually like to participate in these shopping livestreams, if the products they were selling are any good, and also maybe try and figure out why there are so many damn shopping livestreams seemingly everywhere nowadays. What do you guys think? Who wants a mysterious wig of mysterious origin?

Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a collosal disappointment. It apes the most superficial elements of a Bioware game, making no effort to modernize what is a now fairly dated formula, while delivering absolutely none of writing, characterization, rpg depth and imagination that made previous Bioware games so great.

If you want to react to any video, make a youtube poop, remix, put it as a clip in one of your videos or ""dub"" it for your country is 100% ok for me, just put the credits in the description (links for the original video and channel), is not that hard, some of us want to let people know who is the creator.

and Please, DO NOT REUPLOAD OR MONETIZE A COMPILATION WITH ANY VIDEO,  I really don't want to report.

Three consecutive finals. The only team to lift the Summoner’s Cup more than once: T1. The most dominant Worlds dynasty of all time. At the heart of each of those rosters is the greatest player in League of Legends history, Faker. This year, he’s determined to lead Zeus, Oner, Gumayusi, and Keria to T1’s fifth World Championship and back-to-back titles.

T1’s journey in 2024 has been far from easy. As the fourth seed from the LCK, they were the final team to qualify for Worlds, starting with an 0-1 record in the Swiss Stage. Yet, they’ve only grown stronger, overcoming their regional rivals GEN and silencing any doubts along the way.

However, in the way of T1’s fifth title stands Bilibili Gaming, China’s top seed and arguably the best team in the world. Led by the ferocious Bin in the top lane, BLG is ravenous for a World Championship to bring the LPL back to global dominance. With Knight in the midlane seeking revenge against T1 for knocking him out of Worlds 2023 with JDG, and world-class talent across every lane in Xun, Elk, and ON, BLG is determined to secure the 2024 Summoner’s Cup.

Nuclear Weapons today are far more powerful than those used in World War II. For example, the B83 nuclear bomb, the largest in the U.S. arsenal, is 80 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This single Nuclear Weapon could destroy an entire city like Beijing, causing millions of deaths and injuries.

Submarine-launched missiles like the Trident II carry multiple Nuclear Weapons. Each missile can deliver up to eight warheads, each 30 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. A single Trident II could devastate a city like Moscow, resulting in over 2.8 million immediate fatalities.

China's Dongfeng 5 missile is another example of the terrifying power of Nuclear Weapons. It can carry up to 12 warheads, each 66 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. If aimed at a city like Washington, D.C., the impact would be catastrophic, with over a million fatalities.

Russia's R-36 missile, known as the ""Satan"" missile, can carry multiple Nuclear Weapons with immense destructive power. Some versions can deliver a single warhead up to 20 megatons, which is over 1,300 times the Hiroshima bomb.

At the top of the list is Russia's RS-28 Sarmat missile, nicknamed ""Satan 2."" This Nuclear Weapon can carry up to 15 warheads and potentially deliver a 50-megaton bomb, causing unimaginable destruction to cities like New York.

Even though some countries may face setbacks, the existence of these Nuclear Weapons means that even a few could cause unimaginable damage. The true scale of modern Nuclear Weapons shows that in a nuclear war, there are no winners—only devastating loss for humanity.

The last player standing, wins. Dark green names are able to have lives stolen from them when killed by a red or yellow life. Only Red names can kill anyone. 

There are lots of little details to be revealed as the series goes on.
