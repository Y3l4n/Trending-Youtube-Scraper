Before singing on the VS stage, Lisa hits the “pink carpet” in an archival piece previously worn by model Taylor Hill. For Lisa’s performance, designer Zaldy came up with a piece that echoes black chain mail but is actually made up of chrome painted soda can tabs. The famous Victoria’s Secret wings make their way into Lisa’s 3D-printed bra top, with her “Rockstar” logo nestled in the center. Lisa also talks with us about her excitement before the show, including how much she can’t wait to see Tyla and Cher perform.

If a Sim dies with Unfinished Business they can still live(?) their dreams as a Ghost, and still earn rewards. The ultimate reward for completing Bucket Lists and Unfinished Business is Rebirth.For Sims who want to live life on the dark side there are two new careers; an off-screen Mortician career and an active Reaper career which will let you go work for Grim at his secret office as well as travel to reap souls.There's a lot of eerie fun to get into off the clock as well. Explore Crypts, build your Thanatlogy skill, collect tarot cards, and even adopt a Pet Crow.Death affects different Sims in different ways. Create fully custom Grieving Rituals and decorate Caskets and Gravesites according to the wishes of the departed Sim or their loved ones. There are 4 types of grief which Sims may experience depending on their personalities and their relationship to the deceased.Sims can also prepare for their own deaths in life by creating Wills and deciding who to pass on Heirlooms, assets, and children should they pass away.The journey doesn't end with death. Sims can continue on as Ghosts and even learn new supernatural powers. Ghosts who are helpful while haunting will earn Goodwill essence while Ghosts who think it's fun to be frightening will earn Fear essence. Both essences can be sold for Simoleans.Embrace the Macabre (one of 3 new traits!) in Life & Death.Available October 31 at 10AM PT on EA App PC/Mac, Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation®4, and PlayStation®5.

The successor to LaFerrari. And by extension, a halo Ferrari supercar with a lineage that stretches back from LaFerrari, through Enzo, F50 and F40, to 288 GTO. No pressure, then…It’s a once-a-decade occurrence, the LaFerrari having been revealed way back in 2013. That car was Ferrari’s first hybrid, with the electrically boosted V12 powertrain pumping 963hp to the rear wheels. Eleven years on, there’s more electrical assistance, more power, more driven wheels, much more aero, but fewer cylinders…So, how does the new Ferrari F80 move the game on from LaFerrari, and stack up to its predecessors?

It produces over twice as much thrust as the Saturn V that took humans to the moon. The goal of the test is to get further along than IFT-4 in June, 2024. If all goes well, Starship will re-enter in the Indian Ocean about 65 minutes after it lifts off from Starbase, TX, on a suborbital trajectory. And perhaps more exciting, this will be the first time SpaceX will be attempting to catch the Super Heavy booster with the launch tower! Get your tickets to the Astro Awards!!!

Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. We discovered the world of “travel hacking” while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world.Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to “normal life.” We started this channel to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!After ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) We are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!00:00 Epic Iceland road trip!01:23 Day 1 moving in our camper11:53 surprise northern lights! 15:11 Day 219:15 leaving the pavement behind23:58 first river crossings28:16 Day 336:04 insane wind speeds41:47 bloops"

The world lost a legend. His family lost their rock. Lindsay lost the love of her life. Their children have lost their best friend. But we have not lost hope. Justin loved life more than anything. His passion for living was rivaled only by his devotion to his family. His wife and his four precious kids were his reason for living, the reason he got out of bed every morning and his sole purpose on earth.He never would have wanted to leave them this way but we pray that he can see the armies of earthly angels surrounding his family at this most desolate time. There are no words to describe the pain or confusion we are all feeling right now, but if you knew Justin you know he would infuse this moment with optimism and positivity. He’d grab this agony by the horns and ride it through the impending storm with his family on his back. So we pick up the pieces. We remember him. We honor him. We lean on his strength. And we find a way. We move forward with faith, however impossible it may seem, and look forward to the day we are together again.We are eternally grateful for the outpouring of love and support the family has already received. For those who wish to pay their respects and anyone looking to be inspired by his exemplary life you can find more information on his obituary page: https://www.andersonmortuary.com/obituaries/justin-binghamThank you.

Sí,Eso es para usarlo yMi cuerpo está diciendo…Yo tengo derecho de portarme mal Pa’ pasarla bienEstoy suelta y ahoraPuedo hacer lo que quiera Se pasa rico solteraAun huele a verano aquí¿Qué tiene de malo?

A brand new epic Wallace & Gromit family adventure, the first full length feature film in 19 years since BAFTA and Academy Award-winning The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Coming to Netflix January 3, 2025.

From the brilliant Aardman and four-time Academy Award®-winning director Nick Park and Emmy Award-nominated Merlin Crossingham comes Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl. In this next installment, Gromit’s concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his inventions proves justified, when Wallace invents a “smart” gnome that seems to develop a mind of its own. When it emerges that a vengeful figure from the past might be masterminding things, it falls to Gromit to battle sinister forces and save his master… or Wallace may never be able to invent again!

As the name suggests, its crisp flat surfaces and full-width light bars have more than a passing resemblance to the Cybertruck, too.This, then, is Musk's vision of a grand autonomous future, and he promises the Robotaxi will be in full production by 2026, with prices starting from $30,000.A fleet of 20 fully functioning prototypes were built to run around the Warner Bros. Studio lot – the venue for Musk’s big reveal – and take passengers on short, obstacle-laden routes. Top Gear duly hailed one, so join our Editor-in-Chief, Jack Rix, for a first ride in the new Tesla Robotaxi…Subscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGearWANT MORE TOP GEAR?Listen to the Top Gear Magazine Podcast: https://topgear.podlink.to/PodcastSign up for our newsletter: https://www.topgear.com/newsletter-signup00:00 Intro03:20 Robotaxi04:55 Robotaxi Ride08:12 Walkaround10:36 Chat with Chief Designer 13:30 Tesla Bot15:12 Chat with Marques Brownlee24:22 ConclusionMORE ABOUT TOP GEAR:Welcome to the official home of Top Gear on YouTube.
